    <p class="text-muted">A Hindu temple, often mandir[a] in India, is a symbolic house, seat and body of divinity for Hindus. It is a structure designed to bring human beings and gods together, using symbolism to express the ideas and beliefs of Hinduism.[3][4] The symbolism and structure of a Hindu temple are rooted in Vedic traditions, deploying circles and squares..[5] It also represents recursion and the representation of the equivalence of the macrocosm and the microcosm by astronomical numbers, and by "specific alignments related to the geography of the place and the presumed linkages of the deity and the patron".[6][7] A temple incorporates all elements of the Hindu cosmos — presenting the good, the evil and the human, as well as the elements of the Hindu sense of cyclic time and the essence of life — symbolically presenting dharma, kama, artha, moksa, and karma.[8][9][10]</p>

It is responsible for housing updated information in order to meet the user's needs on a daily basis. A library provides physical (hard copies documents) or digital access (soft copies) materials, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both. A library's collection can include printed materials and other physical resources in many formats such as DVD, CD and Cassette as well as access to information, music or other content held on bibliographic databases.</p>

  <h4>In today’s era, a child must be holistically developed in order to survive in challenging and demanding environment. Globalization demands a new dimension to our approach to education. We, thus have to recognize the need for a globally relevant education. Such an education would mean imparting skills that would develop mental ability in individuals to confidently interact and work in diverse environmental or situations.

    I strongly believe that a school is a place where right attitude in child gets developed through mentoring and suitable environment to get ready for the future challenges.
    
    At DPS Pali Road, unlike traditional way of teaching, we emphasize on strengthening the concepts through various other innovative ways too. A wide range of multi-dimensional activities are organized which go a long way in propelling a self-belief, confidence in decision making and problem solving along with chiseling of soft skills.
    
    We promote the joy and excitement of learning and also enjoy the pleasure of our achievements.
    
    New ideas & suggestions to enhance the educational environment and culture in the school are always welcome.</h4>
